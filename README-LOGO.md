# How to Replace the Daisy AI Logo

Follow these simple steps to replace the default logo with your own custom "Daisy AI" logo:

## Option 1: Direct Replacement (Easiest)

1. Create your logo image with the text "Daisy AI"
2. Save it as `logo.png`
3. Upload it to the `/public` directory, replacing the existing file
4. That's it! Your new logo will appear automatically

## Option 2: Using a Different Filename

If you want to use a different filename or format:

1. Upload your logo image to the `/public` directory
2. Open the file `src/app/components/Logo.tsx`
3. Change the `src` attribute from `/logo.png` to your new filename (e.g., `/your-logo.jpg`)

## Logo Image Recommendations

- **Format**: PNG or SVG (preferred for best quality)
- **Dimensions**: Aim for around 160px width Ã— 40px height (or 4:1 ratio)
- **Background**: Transparent background works best
- **Content**: Include "Daisy AI" text in the logo or alongside it
